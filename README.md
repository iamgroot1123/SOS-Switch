The main objective of this project is to create an SOS switch system that offers a straightforward and efficient method for users to send emergency messages and make calls when they are in a dangerous situation or require assistance. This SOS switch can be seamlessly integrated into a wide array of devices, including smartphones, wearable gadgets, vehicles, and home appliances. The system utilizes diverse wireless communication technologies, such as GSM, to transmit vital information, including the user's location, to designated recipients.
